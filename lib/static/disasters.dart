            "description": '''WHAT IS AN EARTHQUAKE? 
Earthquakes are natural vibrations of the surface of the Earth, caused by the sudden release of a lot of energy.
In many regions of the lithosphere there can be many phenomenas that compress and deform the rocks, which pile up huge masses of energy.
During the earthquake all the energy is suddenly released like elastic waves and heat; those waves converted to seismic waves that we can feel.
The point within the Earth where the energy is first released is called hypocenter , from where the elastic vibrations (called L waves) propagate in every direction, to the surface and to the centre of the Earth.
The epicenter is the first point on the surface touched by the waves and from there  they propagate in every directions. (they are called P and S waves)

WHERE DO EARTHQUAKES ARE PROBABLE TO HAPPEN?
Some regions of the lithosphere, called seismic area, are places where earthquakes occur more, even if not regularly but every time with a different hypocenter.
The distribution is not random:
The crust (the more superficial part of our planet) and the first part of the mantel are connected together and this “skin” of the Earth is divided in many different pieces like a puzzle that keep bumping and sliding past one another as they move in opposite directions.
These pieces are called tectonic plates.
Along the border of this tectonic plates there can be large fault zones which can be  the location of major volcanic eruptions, earthquake epicenters, and movement of the Earth’s crust.
So even if we can not exactly determinate where a earthquake is going to happen, we can make a probabilistic forecast about certain regions.
At present earthquake prone countries are Indonesia, Mexico, Italy, China, Iran, Turkey, Japan, Philippines, Perù, California, India, Nepal.

WHICH ARE THE DAMAGE?
We know that during an earthquake the ground shakes.
Buildings can be damaged by this shakes, this is one of the principal cause of death during this type of disaster.
In the hills area there is a probability that earthquakes can cause landslides.
Certain types of earthquake cause tsunami too; in fact they are the result of the deformation of the oceanic crust during an earthquake or a volcanic eruptions.''',

WHAT IS A WILDFIRE?
Wildfire is a fire that is burning strongly and without control in an area of grass or combustible vegetation.
It creates lot of gases, smog and light.
Earth is a really flammable planet because of its dry climates, carbon-rich vegetation, oxygen in the atmosphere, lightning and volcanic activities.
For examples in Australia and China the main cause of wild fire are lightnings, in Africa, Central America,Fiji, Mexico, New Zealand, South America, and Southeast Asia wildfire are caused by the human activities, such as agriculture.
The spread of wildfires depends on different factors such as the topography.

WHICH ARE THE DAMAGE?
Wildfires can have different effects, not only for humans like burns or the destruction of buildings but even for the environment.
In fact from a fire some gases like carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide or nitrogen dioxide and even smoke.''',
