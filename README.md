## Why?

The code of the application should be open-source so what better place than GitHub to share it?

This app has been developed to solve the Nasa app challenge, but a very important thing is that my team and I had a lot of fun during the process of developement and organization. 
I personally wrote the code and my team mates contributed by providing the data that we deemed necessary to include within the application.
A big THANKS to my team mates: Martina, Andrea, Arpita.

Thanks to [Nasa](https://www.nasa.gov/) for organizing the event and giving us this chance to show what we can do, as a united community of people.

## What about the app?
The app was written using the [Flutter framework](https://flutter.io) developed by Google Â®.<br>
It comes to solve the disaster recovering process and the panic prevention that people unfortunately have to face when a disaster or natural disaster occurs.

## Any failures?
Yes, but nothing serius. Unfortunately my actual team-mates and I met each other on the morning of the start of the race, each of us was thinking of parcipating individually, then we met and decided to participate as a team. In 24 hours we have been able to set up a functioning application that tries to solve the problem posed by the challenge.

__Missing features:__<br>
During the development phase we realized that we would not have had enough time to include all the features that came to mind while I was writing code, so we tried to stick as much as possible to the challenge. Obviously we have included some customizations that have made the current application a sort of mock-up for its future evolution.

Personally I think an application to be used in case of emergency does not need internet connection, but I'm thinking about creating a [LoRaWan](https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan) infrastructure to manage the exchange of data between devices even if a disaster makes it difficult, thus developing an intra network which can be used in case of national and international emergency.<br>
